# Simple Website

This is just a simple, plain HTML/CSS/JS template to create a website. It main purpose was to setup webpack from scratch.
This setup is based on [this](https://medium.com/@jonas_duri/build-a-landing-page-with-webpack-4-6efe83deb7fe) post.
Thanks to: [@Gioni06](https://github.com/Gioni06) for the detailed explanation in his tutorial.
